## Robot

# To Do
  1. Program the Controller
  2. Finish Bluetooth and message code
  3. Test Controller
  4. Design Controller case
  5. Finish multithreading code
  6. Finish Robot Body

# Scope:

  This project will be comprised of a robot that will be able to perform various functions and a remote control that will initially control the robot. The robot will be able to communicate with an individual and answer questions and making conversations. This "intelligence" will begin in the form of a basic chat bot and will become more advanced as the project continues. The remote will being as a main source control for the robot. As the robots intelligence increases, the remote will become less used and more of a manual override.
  
  The remote will have two PSP joysticks in order to control movement and body rotation. There will also be four tactile buttons that will be able to signal certain functions and actions. These functions will be determined based on need and possible debugging needs. The signals will be sent to the robot over bluetooth. The remote will have a bluetooth module in order to send these commands to the robot. 
  
  The robot will able to communicate with the user using a microphone and speacker. The audio recorded by microphone will be analyzed by a Raspberry Pi Zero W and converted to text then a response will be formed and outputed by the Raspberry Pi Zero W. Currently the bluetooth module in the Raspberry Pi made this a great choice for the controller of the robot.
